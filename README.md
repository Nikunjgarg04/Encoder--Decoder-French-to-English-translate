# Encoder--Decoder-French-to-English-translate
The Encoder-Decoder model is mainly a concept in the NLP field. It does not specifically value a specific algorithm, but a general term for a class of algorithms. Encoder-Decoder can be regarded as a general framework, under which different algorithms can be used to solve different tasks. Translation is one of the application of Encoder and Decoder

One of the most significant features of the Encoder-Decoder framework is that it is an End-to-End learning algorithm. Such models are often used in machine translation, such as translating French to English . Such a model is also called Sequence to Sequence learning. The so-called encoding is to convert the input sequence into a fixed-length vector and decoding is to convert the previously generated fixed vector into an output sequence.
